### Machine Learning â€“ Supervised & Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains my learnings and practice work from the **Skills4Future Program** by **Edunet Foundation**, covering both **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning** techniques in Machine Learning.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is used when the dataset contains both input features and corresponding output labels.

**Topics Learned:**
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees & Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is used when the dataset has no output labels, and the goal is to find hidden patterns.

**Topics Learned:**
- k-Means Clustering  
- Hierarchical Clustering  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Dimensionality Reduction  
- Applications: Customer Segmentation, Data Compression
